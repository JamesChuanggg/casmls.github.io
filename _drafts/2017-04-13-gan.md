In this week's session, Yixin has led the discussion of two papers about GANs. The first paper, 
"Generalization and Equilibrium in Generative Adversarial Nets" by Arora et al. [1],  is a theoretical investigation 
of GANs, and the second paper, "Improved Training of Wasserstein GANs" by Gulrajani et al. [2], gives an new training 
method of Wasserstein GAN.

# GAN and Wasserstein Gan
GAN training is a two-player game in which the generator minimizes the divergence between its generative distribution 
and the data distribution while the discriminator tries to distinguish the samples from the generator's distribution and 
the real data samples. We say the generator "wins" when the discriminator performs no better than random guess. 

The optimization problem of the baic GAN is a min-max problem, 

$$
min_{G} max_{D} E_{x \sim p_{data}} [\log D(x)] + E_{ h \sim p_{Normal}} [\log (1 - D( G(h))]
$$

In another understanding, the best discriminator gives a divergence measure between the generator's distribution 
$$G(h), h \sim p_{Normal}$$, and the data distribution, $$p_{data}$$. If we have $$p_{data}(x)$$ and the discrinator is allowed to be any function, then the generator is 
optimized to minimize the Jesen-Shannon divergence between $$p_{data}$$ and $$G(h)$$. 

People then use Wasserstein distance to measure the divergence between two distributions (See Robin's [post]{https://casmls.github.io/general/2017/02/23/modified-gans.html} on 
Wasserstein GAN). The Wasserstein distance between the data distribution and the generative distribution is 
$$
sup_{f: 1 Lipschitz}  E_{x \sim p_{data}}[f(x)] - E_{x \sim p_{G(h)}}[f(x)] 
$$
Here the $f$ is the discriminator and takes the form of neural network. It is learned from GAN training. The objective is 
to minimize the Wasserstein's distance between these two distributions. 


The first paper works on the following problems:
1. The divergence measure is defined on distributions, but it is calculated by the discriminator on finite samples. 
   How large is the gap?
2. Can the training reach equilibrium?
3. What does it mean whether when the equilibrium is reached?

The second paper works on the problem of 
4. penalize the optimizer so that it searches the optimal discriminator approximately in the 1-Lipschitz space. 


# Generalization of the distance measure 

When sample size is not large enough, for the generator remembering samples is a better strategy than learning the true distribution (at least in the special case of Gaussian distribution). 

The paper then introduces new distance measure, the neural network divergence. 

d(NN)()

Then when the sample size is large enough, the distance between two distributions can be approximated by the distance between their respective samples. 


# equilibrium

Intuition: a generator is always able to win when it can use infinite number of mixture components to approximate 
the data distribution. A less powerful generator with finite but large enough number of mixture component 
can also win the game. 

Set up the game: u and v represent pure strategies of the generator and the discriminator. The payoff of the game 
between the generator and the discriminator is, 
F(u, v)

By von Neumann, mixed strategy always admits equilibrium, but in this ideal case, both the generator and the 
discriminator need to consider infinite number of pure strategies. 

The paper proposes $\epsilon$-approximate equilibrium for finite pure strategies. 

Then the paper shows that, given enough mixtures of generator and discriminators, the generator can approximately win 
the game.

# MIX+GAN: Mixture of generators and discriminators

Following the theoretical analysis, the paper proposes to use mixture of generators and mixture of discriminators. 
The objective is to minimize $T$ generators and their mixture weights, and $T$ discrinimators and their mixture weights.  



# Wasserstein GAN training with gradient penalty (Paper 2)

The paper is based on the nice result that the optimal discriminator (called "critic" in the paper) has 
gradients with norm 1 almost everywhere. Here the gradient is  with respect to $x$, not the parameter of 
the discriminator. 

Gradient Clipping does not work very well for the following reasons. 

1. The optimizer with gradient clipping searches the discriminator in a space smaller than 1-Lipschitz, 
so it biases the discriminator toward simpler functions. 

2. Clipped gradients vanishe or explode as it backpropagate through network layers. 


The theoretical result of the gradient and the drawback of gradient clipping motivates the new method, gradient penalty, 
in the paper. The discriminator gets a penalty if the norm of its gradient is not 1. The objective is 

$$
L = \mathbb{E}_{\tilde{x} \sim p_G}[D(\tilde{x})] - E_{x \sim p_{real}} [D(x)] + 
\lambda E_{\hat{x} \hat{p}} [(||\Nabla_{\hat{x}}||_2 - 1)^2]
$$

$\hat{x}$ is a random point lying on the line between $x$ and $\tilde{x}$. 

In the experiment, GAN training with gradient penalties has faster convergence speed than that with weight clipping.
In the image generation and language modeling task, the models trained with the proposed method often gives better results 
than competing methods.

This is a list:

If your list items span multiple paragraphs, intend the items with three spaces.
Here the list is enumerated.

     This is the second sentence.

This is an inline equation: $$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$. You have to use two
dollar signs to open and close, not one like in Latex.
To have a centered equation, write it as a pararaph that starts and
ends with the two dollar signs:

$$
p(\theta \, | \, y) \propto p(\theta) \, 
p(y \, | \, \theta).
$$

I don't think you can do align blocks yet.

This is `inline  code`. 
Code blocks are intended paragraphs with four spaces:

```python
F = lambda n: ((1+np.sqrt(5))**n - (1-np.sqrt(5))**n) / (2**n * np.sqrt(5))
```

div with the id footnotes and then add a link[<sup>1</sup>](#footnotes)
