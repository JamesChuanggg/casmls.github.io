# Autoregressive Distribution Estimation

This week we discussed Germain et al., MADE and Uria et al., NADE papers on distribution estimation. The main approach of the two papers to model proper joint distributions is similar. That is to modify the structure of the autoencoder neural networks to be consistent with autoregressive models. However, MADE focused on binary data cases whereas NADE extended this idea to real valued data and had more extensive experiments.

# Distribution Estimation
**Set up** 
Given a set of examples $${x^(t)}_t=1^T$$, where $$x \in R^D$, the goal is to estimate a joint distribution $$p(x)$$. This distribution quantifies the statistical properties of data and can be used a generative model to sample new data. This generative model is useful in many applications such as classifications, data denoising or missing data completion.  This problem is relatively easy if the dimensionality of the data is low (_e.g.,_ estimate distribution from many examples of real valued numbers). However, in cases when data is high dimensional (_e.g.,_ number of pixels in an image), estimation of the data distribution becomes difficult. The main problem is that as dimensionalities increases the volume of the space the distribution $$p(x)$$ needs to cover increases exponentially, which make it harder for a finite datasets to give a clear picture of the statistical properties of that space.

This is a list:
* A
* B
* C

If your list items span multiple paragraphs, intend the items with three spaces.
Here the list is enumerated.

1.   This is the first sentence.

     This is the second sentence.

2.   And so on...

3.   And so forth...

This is **bold text**.
This is _italic text_.
This is ~~strikeout text~~.

This is an inline equation: $$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$. You have to use two
dollar signs to open and close, not one like in Latex.
To have a centered equation, write it as a pararaph that starts and
ends with the two dollar signs:

$$
p(\theta \, | \, y) \propto p(\theta) \, 
p(y \, | \, \theta).
$$

I don't think you can do align blocks yet.

This is `inline  code`. 
Code blocks are intended paragraphs with four spaces:

```python
F = lambda n: ((1+np.sqrt(5))**n - (1-np.sqrt(5))**n) / (2**n * np.sqrt(5))
```
This is a figure. Note that `site.base_url` refers to the homepage.
In this case, `abc.png` is located in the `img` folder under root.

![ABC]({{site.base_url}}/img/abc.png)

I've just been copying and pastying references as follows:

### Footnotes
Here's my trick for footnotes. You can write HTML inside markdown, so I just create a
div with the id footnotes and then add a link[<sup>1</sup>](#footnotes)

<div id="footnotes"></div>
1. like this.
